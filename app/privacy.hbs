            data breach occur:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type:disc;padding-left:30px;">
            <li>Within 7 business days</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally
            pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
            principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
            individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by
            data processors.</p>
        <p></p>

            messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
            penalties for violations.</p>
